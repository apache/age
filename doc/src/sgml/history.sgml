 <para>
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> started its life as a personal
  project by Tatsuo Ishii.  In the project it was just a simple
  connection pooling software. So the
  name <productname>Pgpool</productname> came from the fact.  The
  first version was in public in 2003.

 <para>
  In 2004, <productname>Pgpool</productname> 1.0 was released with
  the native replication feature (SQL statement based
  replication). In the same year 2.0 was released with load
  balancing, and support for version 3 frontend/backend protocol. In
  2005, automated fail over and master slave mode support were added.

 <para>
  In 2006, <productname>Pgpool</productname>
  became <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>. The first release 1.0
  eliminated many of restrictions
  in <productname>Pgpool</productname>, for example the number
  of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers was up to 2 in
  <productname>Pgpool</productname>. Also many new features such as
  parallel query mode and PCP commands (PCP stands for "Pgpool
  Control Protocol") were added. Probably the most important change
  made between <productname>Pgpool</productname>
  and <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> was that the project was
  changed from a personal project to a group project owned by the
  Pgpool Development Group.
