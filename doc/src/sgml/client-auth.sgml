 <para>
  Since <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is a middleware that works between
  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers and
  a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database client, so when a
  client application connects to
  the <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>, <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
  in turn connects to the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers
  using the same credentials to serve the incoming client
  connection. Thus, all the access privileges and restrictions defined
  for the user in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> gets
  automatically applied to all <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
  clients, with an exceptions of the authentications
  on <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> side that depends on the
  client's IP addresses or host names.  Reason being the connections
  to the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server are made
  by <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> on behalf of the connecting
  clients and <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server can only
  see the IP address of the
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> server and not that of the actual client.
  Therefore, for the client host based authentications <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> has the
  <literal>pool_hba</literal> mechanism similar to the <literal>pg_hba</literal> mechanism for
  authenticating the incoming client connections.

  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Just like the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file for <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>,
   <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> supports a similar client authentication
   function using a configuration file called <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename>.
   If <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is installed from source code, it also includes the sample
   <filename>pool_hba.conf.sample</filename> file in the default
   configuration directory (<literal>"/usr/local/etc"</literal>).
   By default, pool_hba authentication is disabled, and
   setting <varname>enable_pool_hba</varname>
   to <literal>on</literal> enables it. see
   the <xref linkend="guc-enable-pool-hba"> configuration
    parameter.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    If number of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers is
    only one, or when running in raw mode
    (see <xref linkend="running-mode">),
     <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> is not necessary
     thus <varname>enable_pool_hba</varname> may be being set to off.
     In this case the client authentication method is completely
     managed by <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>. Also number
     of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers is more than
     one, or not running in raw
     mode, <varname>enable_pool_hba</varname> may be being set to off
     as long as the authentication method defined
     by <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
     is <literal>trust</literal>.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   The format of the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> file
   follows very
   closely <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>
   format.
  </para>
  <para>
   The general format of the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> file is
   a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any
   text after the <literal>#</literal> comment character.
   Records cannot be continued across lines.
   A record is made
   up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
   Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted.
   Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g.,
   <literal>all</literal> or <literal>replication</literal>) makes
   the word lose its special meaning, and just match a database, user, or
   host with that name.
  </para>

  <para>
   Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address
   range (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a
   user name, and the authentication method to be used for
   connections matching these parameters. The first record with a
   matching connection type, client address, requested database,
   and user name is used to perform authentication. There is
   no <quote>fall-through</quote> or
   <quote>backup</quote>: if one record is chosen and the authentication
   fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches,
   access is denied.
  </para>

  <para>
   A record can have one of the following formats
   <synopsis>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><replaceable>address</replaceable></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specifies the client machine address(es) that this record matches.
       This field can contain either a host name, an IP address range,
       or one of the special key words mentioned below.
      </para>

      <para>
       An IP address range is specified using standard numeric notation for
       the range's starting address, then a slash (<literal>/</literal>)
       and a <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask length.
       The mask length indicates the number of high-order bits of the client
       IP address that must match. Bits to the right of this should be zero
       in the given IP address. There must not be any white space between the
       IP address, the <literal>/</literal>, and the CIDR mask length.
      </para>

      <para>
       Typical examples of an IPv4 address range specified this way are
       <literal>172.20.143.89/32</literal> for a single host, or
       <literal>172.20.143.0/24</literal> for a small network, or
       <literal>10.6.0.0/16</literal> for a larger one.
       An IPv6 address range might look like <literal>::1/128</literal> for
       a single host (in this case the IPv6 loopback address) or
       <literal>fe80::7a31:c1ff:0000:0000/96</literal> for a small network.
       <literal>0.0.0.0/0</literal> represents all IPv4 addresses, and
       <literal>::0/0</literal> represents all IPv6 addresses. To specify a
       single host, use a mask length of 32 for IPv4 or 128 for IPv6.
       In a network address, do not omit trailing zeroes.
      </para>

      <para>
       An entry given in IPv4 format will match only IPv4 connections, and
       an entry given in IPv6 format will match only IPv6 connections, even
       if the represented address is in the IPv4-in-IPv6 range.
       Note that entries in IPv6 format will be rejected if the system's C
       library does not have support for IPv6 addresses.
      </para>

      <para>
       You can also write <literal>all</literal> to match any IP address, 
       <literal>samehost</literal> to match any
       of the server's own IP addresses, or samenet to match any address in
       any <literal>subnet</literal> that the server is directly connected to.
      </para>

      <para>
       If a host name is specified (anything that is not an IP address range or
       a special key word is treated as a host name), that name is compared with
       the result of a reverse name resolution of the client's IP address
       (e.g., reverse DNS lookup, if DNS is used). Host name comparisons are
       case insensitive. If there is a match, then a forward name resolution
       (e.g., forward DNS lookup) is performed on the host name to check whether
       any of the addresses it resolves to are equal to the client's IP address.
       If both directions match, then the entry is considered to match.
       (The host name that is used in <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> should be the one that
       address-to-name resolution of the client's IP address returns, otherwise
       the line won't be matched. Some host name databases allow associating an
       IP address with multiple host names, but the operating system will only
       return one host name when asked to resolve an IP address.)
      </para>

      <para>
       A host name specification that starts with a dot (<literal>.</literal>) matches 
       a suffix of the actual host name. So <literal>.example.com</literal> would match
       <literal>foo.example.com</literal> (but not just <literal>example.com</literal>).
      </para>

      <para>
       When host names are specified in <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename>, you should
       make sure that name resolution is reasonably fast. It can be of advantage to
       set up a local name resolution cache such as <acronym>nscd</acronym>.
      </para>

      <para>
       This field only applies to host, hostssl, and hostnossl records.
      </para>
      <para>
       Specifying the host name in address field is not supported prior to
       <productname>Pgpool-II </productname><emphasis>V3.7</emphasis>.

       These two fields can be used as an alternative to the 
       <replaceable>IP-address</replaceable><literal>/</literal>
       <replaceable>mask-length</replaceable> notation.
       Instead of specifying the mask length, the actual mask
       is specified in a separate column.  For
       example, <literal>255.0.0.0</literal> represents an
       IPv4 <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask length
       of <literal>8</literal>,
       and <literal>255.255.255.255</literal> represents a
       <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask length of 32.

  <para>
   Since the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> records are examined
   sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records
   is significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight
   connection match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while
   later records will have looser match parameters and stronger
   authentication methods. For example, one might wish to
   use <literal>trust</literal> authentication for local TCP/IP
   connections but require a password for remote TCP/IP connections. In
   this case a record specifying
   <literal>trust</literal> authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would
   appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider
   range of allowed client IP addresses.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    All pool_hba authentication options described in this section are
    about the authentication taking place between a client and the
    <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>.  A client still has to go
    through the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s authentication
    process and must have the <literal>CONNECT</literal> privilege for
    the database on the backend <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
    server.
   </para>
   <para>
    As far as pool_hba is concerned, it does not matter if a user name
    and/or database name given by a client
    (i.e. <command>psql -U testuser testdb</command>)
    really exists in the backend. pool_hba only cares if a match in the
    <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> can be found or not.

    The method <literal>password</literal> sends the password in

    <quote>sniffing</quote> attacks. It should always be avoided if
    possible. If the connection is protected by SSL encryption then

   <para>
    A benefit to use the method is, the password for authentication is

   <title>LDAP Authentication</title>

   <indexterm zone="auth-ldap">
    <primary>LDAP</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    This authentication method uses LDAP as the password certification method.
    LDAP is used only to validate the user name/password pairs. Therefore the user must
    already exist in the database before LDAP can be used for authentication.
   </para>

   <para>
    LDAP authentication can operate in two modes. In the first mode, which we
    will call the simple bind mode, the server will bind to the distinguished
    name constructed as
    <replaceable>prefix</replaceable> <replaceable>username</replaceable> <replaceable>suffix</replaceable>.
    Typically, the <replaceable>prefix</replaceable> parameter is used to specify
    <literal>cn=</literal>, or <replaceable>DOMAIN</replaceable><literal>\</literal>
    in an Active Directory environment.  <replaceable>suffix</replaceable> is used
    to specify the remaining part of the DN in a non-Active Directory environment.
   </para>

   <para>
    In the second mode, which we will call the search+bind mode, the server first
    binds to the LDAP directory with a fixed user name and password, specified
    with <replaceable>ldapbinddn</replaceable> and <replaceable>ldapbindpasswd</replaceable>,
    and performs a search for the user trying to log in to the database. If no
    user and password is configured, an anonymous bind will be attempted to the
    directory. The search will be performed over the subtree at
    <replaceable>ldapbasedn</replaceable>, and will try to do an exact match of
    the attribute specified in <replaceable>ldapsearchattribute</replaceable>.
    Once the user has been found in this search, the server disconnects and
    re-binds to the directory as this user, using the password specified by the
    client, to verify that the login is correct. This mode is the same as that
    used by LDAP authentication schemes in other software, such as Apache
    <literal>mod_authnz_ldap</literal> and <literal>pam_ldap</literal>. This
    method allows for significantly more flexibility in where the user objects
    are located in the directory, but will cause two separate connections to the
    LDAP server to be made.

   <literal>SCRAM</literal> authentication guards against the man-in-the-middle

  <para>
   However, storing the clear text passwords in the <filename>"pool_passwd"</filename> file
   is not a good idea.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can instead store AES256 encrypted passwords, which will be used for authentication.
   The password is first encrypted using the AES256 encryption with the user provided key
   and then the encrypted password is <literal>base64</literal> encoded and
   an <literal>AES</literal> prefix is added to the encoded string.
   <note>
    <para>
     You can use the <xref linkend="PG-ENC"> utility to create the properly
      formatted AES256 encrypted password.

    If you have <literal>AES</literal> encrypted passwords stored in the

   <para>
    By default the <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> will look for the

    You can also specify the key file using the (-k, --key-file=KEY_FILE)
    command line argument to the <xref linkend="PGPOOL"> command.
     The permissions on .pgpoolkey must disallow any access to world or group.
