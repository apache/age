This directory contains files for simple regression tests.
To execute regress.sh you need to install:

- pgpool_setup
- PostgreSQL 8.3 or later (requires EXTENSION)
- pgbench
- perl PostgreSQL interface
- other tools or libraries required in each test cases

regress.sh: the regression test driver. To execute the test, type "sh regress.sh".
	   To get the lists of arguments accepted by regress.sh type "sh regress.sh -?"

clean.sh: remove files including PostgreSQL DB clusters created by regress.sh.

tests: test scripts live here. Each test case has its own
	   subdirectory. In the directory the test script resides and the
	   script name must be "test.sh". The script should return exit
	   code 0 upon successful completion of the test. Otherwise it
	   should return non 0 value. To add a new test case, simply
	   create a shell script under this.

	   The test name "001.*" to "050.*" is for regular regression
	   tests, while after "051.*" are for bugs.

	   regress.sh exports following environment variables which can be
	   used by test scripts.
	   
	   PGPOOL_SETUP		file path of pgpool_setup file
	   PGPOOL_INSTALL_DIR	pgpool-II installed directory
	   PGBIN		directory path containing PostgreSQL binaries		
	   JDBC_DRIVER		file path of JDBC driver


log: any output of the test files above is created under the
	  directory. The log file name is same as the test name.

libs.sh: contains some useful bash functions. The file name is
		 exported as "$TESTLIBS",
