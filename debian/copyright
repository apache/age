# If you want to use GPL v2 or later for the /debian/* files use
# the following clauses, or change it to suit. Delete these two lines

# Please also look if there are files or directories which have a
# different copyright/license attached and list them here.
# Please avoid picking licenses with terms that are more restrictive than the
# packaged work, as it may make Debian's contributions unacceptable upstream.
#
# If you need, there are some extra license texts available in two places:
#   /usr/share/debhelper/dh_make/licenses/
#   /usr/share/common-licenses/
