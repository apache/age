* General

- Reset application name to "pgpool" when client disconnects(3.1. why
  not use set command?) -> Done.
  - Use reset_query_list to reset to "pgpool" for client disconnection
  - Reset to client specified application name when reusing existing
    connection.

- Allow to call pcp commands/show commands as a stored procedures of
  PostgreSQL(3.1 SRAOSS)

- Allow client encoding conversion. This was possible in pgpool-I

- Avoid cross pgpool process deadlock situation. This is a long
  standing problem since pgpool-II was born (pgpool-I avoids this by
  setting timeout)

- If DISCARD ALL is specified in the reset_query_list and transaction
  is not closed when client disconnects, automatically issue ABORT
  before issuing DISCARD ALL

- Allow to specify queries issued when starting sessions

- Audit functionality?

- Make accept queue

- Graceful attaching a node

* Query handling

- Allow multi statement

- Enhance DROP DATABASE handling (not disconnect all idle connections)

* Replication

- Allow per table replication

- Allow per session level and query level load balancing

- More reliable way to replicate SEQUENCES

- Allow to replicate OIDs, XIDs

* Master/slave mode

- Allow to use more than 1 standbys(3.1)

* On line recovery

* Query cache

- Cache invalidation

- More efficient cache (memcache?)

* Log

- Multiple log levels(3.1, but low priority)

- Multiple log destinations(3.1, but low priority)

* Parallel query

- Performance enhance for more complex queries

- Allow to handle transaction

- Allow to handle extended queries

- process alias in FROM clause

db=# select * from data1 as d1 inner join data2 as d2 on d1.id=d2.id;

2008-03-11 10:28:17 LOG:   pid 6186: statement: SELECT pool_parallel("SELECT d1.id, d1.aaaa, d1.bbbb, a.cccc FROM data1")

- process USING clause in JOIN

* pgpoolAdmin

- Allow to use double quotation in reset_query_list

- German messages

- Allow to run pgpoolAdmin on a host different from a host which
  pgpool-II is running on(3.2?)

- Allow to stop PostgreSQL from pgpoolAdmin to make the on-line
  recovery more convenient(pgpool_stop()?)

* Docs

- Write libpcp API docs

- French documentations(3.1)

- German documentations(3.1)
